# Movie-Rating-
suggests ratings for movies based on age 


Create a program that will help a movie goer know which movie ratings will be appropriate for
them or their family. Allow the user to enter an age and then based on that age suggest movie
ratings that are most appropriate for them. G rated films are appropriate for everyone. PG
should be suggested for anyone above age 5. PG-13 should be suggested for anyone at least 13
years old. R should be suggested for anyone at least 17 years of age. Inform anyone under 17
that they will not be able to even purchase a ticket for a rated R movie without an accompanying
adult. Make sure to check that the age entered by the user is not less than 0. If the age entered is
below 0 give them an error message.
